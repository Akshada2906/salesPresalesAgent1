    "content": "Nitor Technology is pleased to submit this proposal to Symphony AI, a leader in retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) software solutions. Symphony AI seeks to enhance its ability to conduct and analyze A/B tests within retail environments to drive growth and optimize marketing campaigns.  Their current lack of a streamlined testing platform hinders efficient iteration and decision-making.  Nitor proposes a user-friendly application built on Azure, leveraging Logi Analytics for intuitive data visualization and analysis, empowering Symphony AI to accelerate testing cycles and gain actionable insights.  Nitor's deep expertise in Azure and data analytics, combined with our focus on delivering business value, ensures a rapid and successful implementation.",

    "title": "Our Understanding",
    "content": "Symphony AI currently lacks a centralized platform for managing and analyzing A/B tests in retail stores. This results in a fragmented process, involving manual data collection, disparate spreadsheets, and slow analysis.  This inefficient system leads to several key pain points: delayed decision-making regarding marketing campaigns and product offerings, missed opportunities due to slow iteration cycles, and an inability to readily compare key performance indicators (KPIs) across test and control groups.  The business impact includes decreased efficiency, reduced ROI on marketing investments, and potentially lost revenue due to suboptimal strategies.  Our future state vision for Symphony AI involves a single, unified platform for managing the entire A/B testing lifecycle, from planning to analysis. This platform will provide real-time data visualization, automated reporting, and streamlined workflows.  Success will be measured by a quantifiable increase in the speed of test execution and analysis, a significant improvement in the accuracy of decision-making based on data-driven insights, a demonstrable increase in sales lift from successful A/B tests, and a high level of user satisfaction among Symphony AI's internal teams and their clients.  Specific metrics will include a reduction in the time to analyze test results (e.g., from X days to Y days), an increase in the number of A/B tests conducted per month (e.g., from Z tests to W tests), and a measurable percentage increase in sales lift attributable to successful tests (e.g., X%).",
