The proposed solution leverages existing infrastructure and APIs.\n\n\n## Payment Terms and Conditions\n\n*   **Currency:** USD\n*   **Payment Schedule:** Milestone-based payments as outlined in the Milestones tables above.  50% upfront payment upon signing the contract, 50% upon successful completion and acceptance of each milestone.\n*   **Invoice Terms:** Invoices will be issued within 5 business days of milestone completion.  Payment is due within 15 business days of invoice date.\n*   **Interest on Late Payments:** A late payment fee of 1.5% per month will be applied to any overdue payments.\n*   **Right to Halt Work for Non-Payment:**  We reserve the right to halt work on the project until outstanding payments are received.\n\n\n**Note:** The Bloomberg market data subscription cost is not included in these estimates and should be considered separately by PhonePe.  These costs are highly variable based on usage, and PhonePe will need to factor existing arrangements into the overall project budget.  The above approaches provide a robust and scalable solution while remaining within the specified budget constraints.",
