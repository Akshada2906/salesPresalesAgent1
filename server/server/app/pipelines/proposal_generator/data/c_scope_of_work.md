**Scope of Work: REPO Trading Platform for Affin Moneybrokers**

**1. Project Overview**

This document outlines the scope of work for the development of a REPO trading platform for Affin Moneybrokers by Nitor Infotech. The project aims to automate Malaysian REPO/Reverse REPO transactions, ensuring compliance with GMRA regulations and supporting key participants (Affin, interbank, Bursa Malaysia, BNM).  The project timeline is four months, with a budget of USD 20,000.

**1.1 In Scope**

*   **Core Trading Engine:** Development of a robust and scalable trading engine capable of automating REPO/Reverse REPO transaction execution, including order entry, trade confirmation, and settlement. This will include functionality for managing different trade types and incorporating necessary compliance checks.
*   **Collateral Management Module:**  Development of a module for efficient collateral management, including tracking, valuation, and margin calls, adhering to GMRA regulations.
*   **Real-time Compliance Monitoring:** Implementation of real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities to ensure adherence to GMRA and other relevant Malaysian regulations throughout the trading lifecycle.  This includes generating necessary audit trails.
*   **Market Data Integration:** Integration with a designated market data provider (e.g., Bloomberg – client to specify API access and details) to obtain real-time pricing and market information.  This will involve building secure and efficient data ingestion and processing capabilities.  The scope includes handling initial data feed setup and testing, and providing documentation on integration process.
*   **System Security:** Implementation of robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure system integrity, including user authentication, authorization, and data encryption. This will align with industry best practices and relevant Malaysian regulations.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:** Development of basic reporting functionalities to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide insights into trading activity.  This will include customizable reporting for daily trades, collateral positions, and compliance metrics.
*   **Testing and Documentation:** Comprehensive testing of the platform, including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  This will include the creation of detailed system documentation, user manuals, and API specifications.
*   **Deployment Support:** Assistance with deployment of the platform to a client-specified environment.  This will include initial setup and configuration support.

**1.2 Out of Scope**

*   **Data Governance:**  Nitor Infotech will not be responsible for the overall data governance strategy or implementation of data quality measures beyond what is directly required for the functionality of the REPO trading platform. Data cleansing and migration from legacy systems is not included.
*   **Integration with Existing Systems (Beyond Market Data):**  Integration with Affin Moneybroker's existing systems beyond the designated market data provider will require a separate scope of work and additional costs.
*   **Advanced Analytics & Machine Learning:**  Implementation of advanced analytics or machine learning features for predictive modeling or algorithmic trading is beyond the scope of this project.
*   **Post-Deployment Support & Maintenance:** Ongoing maintenance, support, and bug fixes after the initial deployment will require a separate service agreement.
*   **Mobile Application Development:** Development of a mobile application for the trading platform is excluded.
*   **Regulatory Compliance Audits:**  Nitor Infotech will not conduct independent regulatory compliance audits.  We will provide the necessary tools and functionalities for Affin Moneybrokers to meet their compliance obligations.
*   **Training beyond initial platform overview:** Extensive training beyond a brief overview on initial use and operation of the platform will be a separate engagement.

**1.3 Client Responsibilities**

*   Provide timely access to necessary systems, APIs, and data sources (including market data feed details and credentials).
*   Provide key personnel with the relevant domain expertise for requirements clarification, testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
*   Provide a suitable and secure deployment environment meeting pre-agreed specifications (servers, databases, network).
*   Review and approve all deliverables throughout the project lifecycle.
*   Provide feedback on testing and address identified issues promptly.


**1.4 Assumptions**
