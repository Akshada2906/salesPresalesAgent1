**Scope of Work: REPO Trading Platform for Affin Moneybrokers**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of work for the development of a REPO Trading Platform for Affin Moneybrokers by Nitor Infotech.  The project aims to automate Malaysian REPO/Reverse REPO transactions, ensuring GMRA compliance and supporting key participants (Affin, interbank, Bursa Malaysia, BNM).  The project is constrained by a budget of USD 50,000 and an unspecified timeline (requiring further clarification from the client).

**1.1 In Scope**

* **Core Trading Engine:** Development of a core trading engine to automate REPO and Reverse REPO transaction execution, including order management, trade confirmation, and settlement processing.  This will include functionalities for managing different trade types and incorporating necessary compliance checks based on GMRA regulations.

* **Collateral Management Module:**  Implementation of a module for efficient collateral management, tracking collateral values, and ensuring compliance with margin requirements.  This will include functionality to manage various collateral types.

* **Real-time Compliance Monitoring:**  Integration of real-time compliance monitoring to ensure adherence to GMRA regulations throughout the trading lifecycle.  Alerts and reporting features will be included to highlight potential compliance breaches.

* **Market Data Integration (Partial):** Integration with a select subset of market data feeds (to be determined collaboratively with Affin Moneybrokers based on the budget and the timeline).  The initial focus will be on essential market data required for trade execution and risk management.  Prioritization of data feeds will be based on criticality and cost-effectiveness.

* **Integration with Existing Systems (Limited):**  Integration with pre-selected existing Affin Moneybrokers systems (to be specified collaboratively with Affin Moneybrokers).  The scope will be limited to ensure feasibility within the given budget and timeline, prioritizing high-impact integrations.

* **Security and Scalability:** Implementation of robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure platform scalability to accommodate future growth and new instruments.

* **User Interface (UI) Development:**  Development of a user-friendly interface for traders to execute trades, monitor positions, and access key information.

* **Testing and Quality Assurance:**  Comprehensive testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT), to ensure the quality and reliability of the platform.


**1.2 Out of Scope**

* **Full Market Data Integration:**  Integration with all market data sources is considered out of scope due to potential cost and time constraints.  Prioritized integration will be addressed in phase 1.

* **Comprehensive Integration with all Existing Systems:** Complete integration with all of Affin Moneybrokers' existing systems is beyond the scope of this project due to time and resource constraints. This will be addressed in future phases.

* **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:**  Sophisticated analytical tools and advanced reporting features are out of scope for this initial phase.

* **Mobile Application Development:**  A dedicated mobile application for the platform is excluded from this project.

* **Data Migration:**  Data migration from existing systems is out of scope unless specific data and requirements are provided and agreed upon.

* **Regulatory Compliance Consulting:** Nitor Infotech will deliver a system designed to meet GMRA compliance but will not provide legal or regulatory compliance consulting services.

* **Post-Implementation Support:** This initial contract does not include ongoing maintenance or support beyond the initial testing and deployment phase. A separate support contract will need to be established post-implementation.


**1.3 Client Responsibilities**

* **Access to Systems and Data:** Provide Nitor Infotech with timely access to relevant systems, databases, and APIs required for integration.
* **Data Provision:** Provide necessary data sets for testing and validation.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Dedicate sufficient resources to participate actively in the UAT process and provide timely feedback.
* **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):**  Provide access to key SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) with expertise in REPO trading, GMRA regulations, and existing systems to support development and testing.
* **Approval Process:**  Establish clear and efficient approval processes for design reviews, code reviews, and testing milestones.


**1.4 Assumptions**

* **Data Availability:**  Affin Moneybrokers will provide complete and accurate data sets required for development and testing in a timely manner.
* **API Availability and Stability:**  APIs for market data providers and existing Affin Moneybrokers systems are stable, reliable, and adequately documented.
* **Client Resources:** Affin Moneybrokers will commit sufficient resources and expertise to collaborate with Nitor Infotech throughout the project.
* **Regulatory Compliance:**  All necessary regulatory approvals and permits for the project are the responsibility of Affin Moneybrokers.
* **Project Timeline:** The project timeline requires further clarification from the client.  A detailed timeline will be developed collaboratively upon further discussion of requirements and priorities.
* **Budget Allocation:** The budget of USD 50,000 requires detailed breakdown to ensure feasibility of the initially outlined scope.

**2. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete upon successful completion of all in-scope deliverables, successful UAT by Affin Moneybrokers, and formal sign-off by Affin Moneybrokers on the delivered system.  Specific acceptance criteria for each deliverable will be defined in more detail in subsequent documentation.

**3. Project Management**

Nitor Infotech will utilize Agile methodologies to manage the project.  Regular progress reports and status meetings will be conducted to maintain open communication and ensure transparency.

**4. Payment Terms**

Payment terms will be defined in a separate contract.
