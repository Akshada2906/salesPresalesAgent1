**Scope of Work: Trading App Development for Apple**

**1. Project Overview**

This document outlines the scope of work for the development of a trading application for Apple, focusing on automating Malaysian REPO/Reverse REPO transactions.  The project will be undertaken by Nitor Infotech and will adhere to the timeline and budget constraints outlined below.

**1.1 In Scope**

*   **Software Development:** Design, development, testing, and deployment of a trading application capable of automating Malaysian REPO/Reverse REPO transactions. This includes:
    *   Integration with key participants' systems (Affin, interbank, Bursa Malaysia, BNM) via APIs (assuming APIs are available and documented;  see Assumptions).  This will involve secure communication protocols and data exchange mechanisms.
    *   Implementation of real-time trade execution functionality, adhering to GMRA compliance standards.
    *   Development of a robust collateral management module within the application.
    *   Integration with a market data feed (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal API – assuming client provides access and necessary licenses; see Assumptions).
    *   Implementation of a secure user authentication and authorization system.
    *   Development of comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities for audit trails and system health.
    *   Unit, integration, and system testing of the application, ensuring all functionalities meet specifications and regulatory requirements.
    *   Deployment of the application to a suitable environment (client-specified or Nitor-managed, see Assumptions).
    *   Provision of basic training to designated Apple personnel on application usage and maintenance.

*   **Documentation:**  Comprehensive technical documentation including system architecture diagrams, API specifications (internal & external), user manuals, and testing reports.

**1.2 Out of Scope**

*   **Data Governance and Compliance:**  This project does not include the development of any data governance framework or compliance monitoring tools beyond those required for the core trading functionality.  This excludes aspects like data warehousing, reporting, or long-term data archiving.
*   **Post-Deployment Support:** This project excludes ongoing maintenance, support, and bug fixes beyond a defined warranty period (3 months post-deployment).  Extended support contracts can be negotiated separately.
*   **Development of New Instruments:** The application will support existing REPO/Reverse REPO instruments only.  Future expansion to handle new instruments will be considered as a separate project.
*   **Third-party System Maintenance:** Nitor Infotech is not responsible for the maintenance or updates of any third-party systems (Bloomberg, bank APIs, etc.).  Nitor will ensure compatibility with the latest stable versions of these systems, however, we are not responsible for downtime related to third-party issues.
*   **Mobile Application Development:**  This project focuses solely on a web-based or desktop application; mobile development is excluded.


**1.3 Client Responsibilities**

*   Provide timely access to all necessary systems, APIs, and data required for integration.
*   Provide clear and detailed specifications for all required functionalities, including business rules and compliance requirements.
*   Allocate sufficient resources (personnel, time) to participate actively in the project, including requirements gathering, testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
*   Provide necessary licenses and access credentials for third-party systems (Bloomberg, etc.).
*   Secure appropriate infrastructure for deployment (if not managed by Nitor Infotech).
*   Review and approve all deliverables in a timely manner.

**1.4 Assumptions**

*   Apple will provide timely access to relevant systems, APIs, and data sources.
*   The APIs provided by Affin, interbank, Bursa Malaysia, and BNM are well-documented, stable, and reliable, and maintain sufficient uptime during the development phase.
*   Apple has sufficient internal resources and expertise to manage deployment and ongoing operational activities after the project completion.
*   Bloomberg Terminal API access and related licenses are provided by Apple.
*   The project environment (hardware, software, network) meets the minimum technical requirements defined by Nitor Infotech.  These requirements will be detailed in a separate document.
*   Apple will provide clear and consistent feedback throughout the development process.


**2.  Project Timeline**

The project timeline is 7 months, broken down into distinct phases (detailed project schedule will be provided separately).

**3. Project Budget**

The total project budget is USD 24,234.00. A detailed budget breakdown will be provided separately.

**4. Acceptance Criteria**

*   Successful completion of all in-scope deliverables.
*   Successful completion of UAT by Apple.
*   Formal sign-off on all deliverables and documentation by authorized Apple representatives.
*   All functionalities meet the agreed-upon specifications and perform as expected within defined performance parameters.


**5. Payment Schedule**

A detailed payment schedule will be provided separately, potentially based on project milestones.

**6. Change Management**

Any changes to the scope of work will require a formal change request process, including the assessment of impact on the timeline and budget.  A change request form will be provided.


This Scope of Work document serves as a high-level overview. A more detailed project plan will be developed and shared upon project initiation.
