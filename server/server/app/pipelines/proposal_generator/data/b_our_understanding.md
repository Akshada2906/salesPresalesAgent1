**Our Understanding:**

**1. About Affin Moneybrokers's Project**

* **Inferred Current State and Challenges:** Affin Moneybrokers likely operates a manual or partially automated REPO trading system, leading to inefficiencies in trade execution, compliance monitoring, and collateral management.  Manual processes increase operational risk, expose them to human error, and hinder scalability.  Integration with existing systems and market data sources might be fragmented, causing data silos and hindering real-time decision-making.  Compliance with GMRA and other Malaysian regulations requires meticulous record-keeping and potentially complex reconciliation processes, posing a significant challenge in the current state.  The lack of a robust, automated platform likely limits Affin's ability to compete effectively in the increasingly dynamic Malaysian REPO market.

* **Project Objectives and Success Criteria:** The primary objective is to automate REPO and Reverse REPO transactions, ensuring full compliance with GMRA and other applicable regulations while seamlessly integrating with existing systems and market data providers. Success will be measured by:
    * **Reduced transaction processing time:** Achieving a significant decrease in the time taken to execute trades.
    * **Improved operational efficiency:** Minimizing manual intervention and reducing operational costs.
    * **Enhanced compliance:** Ensuring full adherence to all relevant Malaysian regulations and minimizing compliance risk.
    * **Increased trading volume and profitability:** Facilitating higher trading volumes with improved risk management.
    * **Improved data visibility and reporting:** Providing real-time insights into trading activity and collateral management.
    * **Seamless integration:**  Successfully integrating with existing systems (specified during the discovery phase) and market data providers like Bloomberg.

* **Proposed Technical Approach:** We propose a modular, cloud-based solution built using a microservices architecture. This approach allows for scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.  The system will integrate with existing infrastructure and leverage APIs for market data feeds and secure communication.  The core components will include:
    * **Trade Execution Engine:**  A high-performance engine for automated trade execution and order management, adhering to GMRA requirements and best practices for trade lifecycle management.
    * **Collateral Management Module:**  A secure module for managing collateral, including automated valuation, monitoring, and margin calls.
    * **Compliance Engine:**  A real-time monitoring system for ensuring compliance with GMRA and all other applicable Malaysian regulations.  This will incorporate robust auditing and reporting functionalities.
    * **Reporting & Analytics Dashboard:**  A user-friendly interface providing real-time insights into trading activity, performance, and risk metrics.
    * **Integration Layer:**  A robust layer to facilitate seamless integration with existing systems and market data providers (Bloomberg Terminal).  This will be developed using industry-standard APIs and messaging protocols.

**2. Implementation Methodology**

* **Phase 0: Discovery & Assessment (2 weeks):**  Detailed requirements gathering, system assessment, existing infrastructure review, and risk assessment.  We will define precise specifications and technical requirements based on a comprehensive understanding of Affin Moneybrokers' current operational landscape.  This phase will also finalize the project scope and deliverables.

* **Phase 1: Planning & Design (4 weeks):**  System architecture design, detailed design specifications, database design, API specifications, security design, and test plan development.  This phase includes prototyping key functionalities to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with Affin Moneybrokers' expectations.

* **Phase 2: Implementation (8 weeks):**  Development, testing, and deployment of the REPO trading platform.  This will involve iterative development sprints with regular demos and feedback sessions to ensure continuous alignment with requirements.  Rigorous quality assurance testing will be conducted throughout this phase.

* **Phase 3: Go-Live & Support (2 weeks):**  Go-live support, user training, and post-implementation support.  This phase involves monitoring system performance, addressing any issues, and providing ongoing support to Affin Moneybrokers.  A comprehensive handover process will ensure a smooth transition to ongoing maintenance.
