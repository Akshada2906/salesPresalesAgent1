**Team Structure:**

The project team will consist of experienced professionals with expertise in financial technology,  Malaysian regulatory compliance (GMRA), secure software development, and real-time data processing. The team will be structured as follows:

Sr. | Role | Resource Count | Justification
---|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1  | Solutions Architect    | 1              | Provides overall technical direction, ensures alignment with client needs, and designs the system architecture to meet the requirements for automated trading, compliance, and integration with existing systems and market data providers like Bloomberg.  Experience in financial systems is crucial.
2  | Backend Developer      | 3              | Develops the core trading engine, integrates with market data APIs (Bloomberg), handles real-time data processing, and implements secure communication protocols. Three developers are needed to manage the complexity of the trading engine, API integrations, and compliance requirements within the 7-month timeframe.
3  | Frontend Developer     | 2              | Develops the user interface for the trading application, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient experience for traders. Two developers are needed to manage UI development, testing, and ensure responsiveness across multiple devices.
4  | Database Engineer      | 1              | Designs and implements the database schema for storing trade data, collateral information, and compliance logs.  Experience with high-performance databases is essential for real-time trading.
5  | QA Engineer            | 2              | Designs and executes test plans, covering functional, performance, security, and compliance testing. Two engineers are needed given the complexity and regulatory requirements, enabling parallel testing efforts.
6  | Compliance Specialist  | 1              | Ensures adherence to GMRA regulations and Malaysian financial regulations throughout the development lifecycle. This role is critical to mitigating legal and operational risks.
7  | DevOps Engineer         | 1              | Manages the deployment pipeline, infrastructure (cloud or on-premise), and monitoring of the application. Essential for ensuring system reliability and scalability.
8  | Project Manager        | 1              | Manages the project timeline, budget, resources, and communication among team members and stakeholders.


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Security:**  Given the sensitive nature of financial transactions, a dedicated security review and penetration testing should be incorporated throughout the development process.  This might involve external security consultants or allocating additional time for internal security reviews within the QA process.
* **Third-party Integrations:**  Expertise in integrating with Bloomberg's API and other market data providers needs to be factored into the Backend Developer's responsibilities or potentially a dedicated integration specialist could be added if complexity requires.
* **Agile Methodology:**  Employing an Agile methodology (Scrum or Kanban) would be highly beneficial for managing the project, enabling iterative development and accommodating potential changes in requirements.


This structure provides a robust team capable of delivering a high-quality, compliant trading application within the 7-month timeframe.  The resource allocation balances the complexities of the project and maintains a reasonable project team size, facilitating efficient communication and collaboration.
