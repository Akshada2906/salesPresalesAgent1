        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
        1. DO NOT use any specific numbers, percentages, or metrics in success stories or benefits
        2. Focus on qualitative outcomes rather than quantitative results
        3. Use phrases like "significant improvement", "substantial reduction", "notable increase" instead of specific percentages
        4. For success stories, focus on the transformation and business impact without specific metrics
        5. Keep all claims verifiable and general
        6. Give atleast 3 responses for each field
