**Scope of Work: REPO Trading Platform for Affin Moneybrokers**

**1. Project Overview**

This document outlines the scope of work for the development of a REPO trading platform for Affin Moneybrokers by Nitor Infotech.  The project aims to automate Malaysian REPO/Reverse REPO transactions, ensuring compliance with GMRA regulations and supporting key participants (Affin, interbank, Bursa Malaysia, BNM).  The project timeline is four months, and the budget is USD 25,000.

**1.1 In Scope**

*   **Development of a core trading engine:** This will include functionalities for trade execution, order management, position tracking, and settlement processing for REPO and Reverse REPO transactions.  The engine will be designed for scalability and performance to handle anticipated transaction volumes.
*   **Integration with market data feeds:**  Integration with Bloomberg API (client to provide API access and relevant licenses) for real-time market data retrieval (price, yield, etc.) will be implemented.  Error handling and data validation will be incorporated.
*   **Compliance module:**  A module will be developed to ensure compliance with GMRA regulations. This includes automated checks and reporting mechanisms for relevant regulatory requirements.
*   **Collateral management module:**  A module to manage collateral for REPO and Reverse REPO transactions.  This will include features for collateral posting, tracking, and valuation.
*   **User interface (UI) development:** A user-friendly interface will be developed for traders and administrators. This will encompass dashboards for monitoring trades, positions, and collateral.
*   **Security implementation:**  Robust security measures will be implemented, including user authentication and authorization, data encryption, and secure communication protocols.
*   **API for Integration:** A well-documented API will be developed to allow for future integration with other Affin Moneybrokers systems.
*   **Testing and quality assurance:** Comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing (UAT), will be conducted to ensure the platform's stability, reliability, and compliance.  Nitor will provide comprehensive documentation for the platform.
*   **Deployment support:**  Nitor will provide support for deploying the platform to a client-specified environment (client responsible for providing server infrastructure and access).

**1.2 Out of Scope**

*   **Integration with all listed participants simultaneously:**  Phased integration will be prioritized given time and budget constraints. The initial release will focus on integration with Affin's internal systems and a subset of key interbank participants.  Integration with Bursa Malaysia and BNM will be evaluated in subsequent phases (if budget allows).
*   **Development of a mobile application:** A mobile application for the platform is beyond the scope of this project.
*   **Advanced analytics and reporting:**  While basic reporting will be included, advanced analytics features will not be developed within this project timeline and budget.
*   **Data migration from legacy systems:**  Data migration is outside the scope unless Affin provides clean, structured data in a readily usable format.  Nitor will need a detailed data migration plan with clear timelines and responsibilities from Affin’s side.
*   **Ongoing maintenance and support:** Post-deployment maintenance and support will be considered as a separate engagement after project completion.
*   **Regulatory Compliance beyond the GMRA:** While the solution will comply with GMRA requirements, other regulatory compliance aspects beyond that are outside of the scope.
*   **Third-party system customization:** Customization of existing third-party systems (e.g. Bloomberg Terminal) is out of scope.
*   **Training:** User training will be provided at a high level but comprehensive training will be an additional engagement.

**1.3 Client Responsibilities**

*   Provide timely access to relevant systems and data required for integration (including Bloomberg API access, internal systems, etc.).
*   Provide clear and concise requirements and feedback throughout the development process.
*   Allocate sufficient resources (personnel) for testing and UAT.
*   Provide a suitable production environment for deployment.  This includes server infrastructure, network configuration and database setup.
*   Review and approve all deliverables in a timely manner.
*   Provide necessary regulatory documentation and guidelines.

**1.4 Assumptions**

*   Affin Moneybrokers will provide timely access to necessary systems, data, and personnel.
*   The Bloomberg API will be stable and reliable during the integration process.
*   Affin Moneybrokers possesses the technical expertise to support the ongoing operation of the platform post-deployment.
*   Adequate resources will be dedicated by Affin Moneybrokers to the project.
*   The existing internal systems of Affin Moneybrokers are stable and well-documented.  
*   Clear communication channels will be established and maintained throughout the project lifecycle.


**2. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete upon successful completion of UAT, successful deployment to the client’s production environment, and final sign-off by Affin Moneybrokers on the delivered system.  Key acceptance criteria include successful execution of REPO/Reverse REPO transactions, accurate compliance monitoring, efficient collateral management, seamless integration with Bloomberg API, and a user-friendly interface.  A detailed acceptance testing plan will be developed collaboratively.

**3. Payment Schedule**

A payment schedule will be agreed upon separately, contingent on the achievement of agreed-upon milestones.

**4. Project Management**

Nitor Infotech will utilize Agile methodologies for project management, with regular progress updates and communication with Affin Moneybrokers.  A dedicated project manager will be assigned to oversee the project.
