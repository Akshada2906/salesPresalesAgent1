**Dependencies:**  Dependencies between phases will be managed using a critical path analysis and closely monitored using project management software. Regular progress meetings and status reports will ensure timely communication and issue resolution.  The development phase is critically dependent on the successful completion of the design and architecture phase.  Testing cannot begin until the development phase is complete.  Deployment is dependent on successful testing.

**Resource Allocation Considerations:** The resource allocation described above is a high-level overview.  A detailed resource plan with specific individual assignments and task breakdowns will be developed and maintained throughout the project lifecycle. This plan will consider individual skillsets and availability.

A detailed Gantt chart illustrating the project timeline and dependencies will be provided separately.
