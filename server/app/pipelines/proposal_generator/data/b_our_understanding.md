**Our Understanding:**

**1. About Affin Moneybrokers's Project**

* **Inferred Current State and Challenges:** Affin Moneybrokers likely operates a manual or semi-automated REPO trading system, facing challenges such as:
    * **Inefficient Trade Execution:** Manual processes lead to delays, increased operational costs, and potential errors.  Real-time monitoring and automated trade confirmation are likely lacking.
    * **Compliance Risks:**  Ensuring GMRA (Government Master Repurchase Agreement) compliance across all transactions, with multiple participants (Affin, interbank, Bursa Malaysia, BNM), is complex and prone to human error.  Manual reconciliation increases the risk of non-compliance penalties.
    * **Limited Scalability and Flexibility:**  The existing system may struggle to handle increasing trade volumes and the introduction of new instruments.  It may lack the flexibility to adapt quickly to evolving market requirements and regulatory changes.
    * **Collateral Management Inefficiencies:** Tracking and managing collateral in a manual system can be challenging, leading to potential delays and increased risk.  Automated collateral management and efficient reporting are likely missing.
    * **Integration Gaps:**  Market data integration (e.g., Bloomberg) and connections with internal systems might be fragmented or non-existent, resulting in data silos and manual data entry.  This creates inefficiencies and data quality issues.
    * **Security Vulnerabilities:** Manual processes and outdated technology increase the risk of security breaches and data loss.


* **Project Objectives and Success Criteria:**  The primary objectives are to automate REPO and Reverse REPO trading, improve operational efficiency, enhance compliance, and scale the platform to meet future demands.  Success will be measured by:
    * **Reduced Trade Execution Time:**  Measurable reduction in the time taken to execute trades.
    * **Improved Compliance:**  Zero instances of GMRA non-compliance.
    * **Enhanced Operational Efficiency:**  Quantifiable reduction in operational costs and manual intervention.
    * **Increased Scalability:**  Ability to handle a significant increase in trade volume and new instruments.
    * **Improved Data Quality:**  Accurate and reliable data throughout the trading lifecycle.
    * **Enhanced Security:**  Implementation of robust security measures to protect sensitive data.


* **Proposed Technical Approach:**  We propose a cloud-based, microservices architecture for the REPO trading platform. This approach offers:
    * **Scalability and Flexibility:**  Microservices allow for independent scaling of individual components, accommodating future growth and new functionalities.
    * **Maintainability and Agility:**  Independent deployment of services allows for faster development cycles and easier maintenance.
    * **Integration Capabilities:**  Seamless integration with market data providers (Bloomberg) and existing internal systems using APIs.
    * **Security and Compliance:**  Built-in security measures and adherence to industry best practices for data protection and regulatory compliance (GMRA).
    * **Cost-Effectiveness:**  Cloud-based infrastructure reduces upfront capital expenditure and provides cost-effective scalability.  The solution will leverage industry-standard technologies to ensure maintainability and reduce long-term costs.  We will prioritize open-source technologies wherever feasible.

**2. Implementation Methodology**

* **Phase 0: Discovery & Assessment (1 week):**  Detailed requirements gathering, assessment of existing infrastructure, and identification of integration points.
* **Phase 1: Planning & Design (2 weeks):** System architecture design, database design, API specifications, security design, and development of detailed implementation plans.
* **Phase 2: Implementation (6 weeks):**  Development, testing (unit, integration, user acceptance testing), and deployment of the REPO trading platform. This includes continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices.
* **Phase 3: Go-Live & Support (3 weeks):** Go-live support, user training, post-implementation review, and ongoing maintenance and support.  This phase includes a defined service level agreement (SLA) for ongoing support.
