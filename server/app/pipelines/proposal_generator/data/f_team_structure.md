**Team Structure:**

The project team will consist of experienced professionals with expertise in financial technology, secure software development, and real-time systems. The team will be structured as follows:

Sr. | Role | Resource Count | Justification
---|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1  | Solutions Architect    | 1              | Provides overall technical direction, ensures alignment with Affin Moneybroker's needs and GMRA compliance, and designs the system architecture for scalability and security.  Critical for a complex financial system.
2  | Backend Developer      | 3              | Develops the core trading platform logic, integrates with market data (Bloomberg), existing systems, and handles transaction processing. Three developers are needed given the complexity, integration requirements, and 4-month deadline.
3  | Frontend Developer     | 2              | Designs and develops the user interface for traders, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient experience. Two developers allow for parallel development and faster iteration.
4  | Database Engineer      | 1              | Designs and implements the database schema for storing trade data, collateral information, and audit trails, ensuring data integrity and performance.  Critical for a high-volume trading system.
5  | QA Engineer            | 2              | Performs comprehensive testing (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing) to ensure the platform's reliability, security, and compliance. Two QA engineers allow for parallel testing and quicker bug resolution.
6  | DevOps Engineer        | 1              | Manages the deployment pipeline, infrastructure, and monitoring of the platform, ensuring high availability and scalability. Essential for a real-time trading system.
7  | Security Engineer      | 1              | Focuses on implementing and testing security measures to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with Malaysian regulations. Crucial for a financial application.
8  | Project Manager        | 1              | Manages the project timeline, budget, resources, and communication, ensuring successful project delivery. Essential for coordinating the diverse team and meeting deadlines.


**Technology Stack Considerations:**  The team should be proficient in technologies suitable for high-performance, low-latency trading systems, such as Java, C++, or Python for backend; React, Angular, or Vue.js for frontend; and a robust database system like PostgreSQL or Oracle.  Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, or GCP) should be considered for scalability and reliability.


**Contingency Planning:**  The project timeline of 4 months is aggressive.  A small buffer (approximately 10%) should be allocated to address unforeseen issues or complexities.  This could involve slightly increasing the resource count for critical roles or adjusting the project scope as needed.  Regular monitoring and progress reporting are essential for early detection and mitigation of potential delays.
