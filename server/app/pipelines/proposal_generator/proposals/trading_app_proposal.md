## License Cost

This project does not require any Power BI licensing.  All data visualization and reporting will be handled within the application itself or through standard tools already available to Apple.


## Payment Terms and Conditions

*   **Currency:** USD
*   **Payment Schedule:** Milestone-based payments as outlined in the Milestone tables for each approach.  50% upfront upon contract signing, and the remaining amount distributed according to milestone completion and approval.
*   **Invoice Terms:** Invoices will be issued upon completion of each milestone. Payment is due within 15 days of invoice date.
*   **Interest on Late Payments:**  A late payment fee of 1% per month will be applied to any overdue payments.
*   **Right to Halt Work for Non-Payment:** We reserve the right to halt work on the project if payment is not received within 30 days of the invoice due date.


We believe both approaches offer compelling solutions within the stipulated budget, with Approach 1 offering a faster time-to-market and Approach 2 providing long-term cost savings.  We are prepared to discuss these options further and tailor them to Apple's specific needs and preferences.
